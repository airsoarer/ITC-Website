            <h2><u>History of the St. Joseph River</u></h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The St. Joseph River (Sakiwasipi) also known as “La Riviere de Miamis” (River of the Miamis) is about 206 miles long (332 km). It runs through Southern Michigan and Northern Indiana.  The St. Joseph River was extremely important
		    to the Native Americans and essential in the colonial exploration, settlement, and administration of New France and the U.S. It was a canoe route between Lake Michigan and the watershed of the Mississippi River.</p><br>
            <p>There are 190 dams in the St. Joseph River, as well as 17 on the river's mainstream. The river flows through Downtown South Bend. South Bend was named after the abrupt turn in the river.
	Many factories were located in South Bend due to the east and west races that were held on the St. Joseph River. The St. Joseph River is inhabited by trout and salmon, making it a great spot for sport fishery.
